# NebulaSwift

Nebula Streaming Client created in Swift & SwiftUI

Originally started due to the lack of picture-in-picture support in the official app, it now supports pretty much all features of the official app, and more. In addition to the iPhone and iPad, it also natively supports the Mac.

## Build

Since I've used the project to try out new things from WWDC22, the *main* branch requires Xcode 14 and macOS 13 or iOS 16. The *release* branch still supports macOS 12 and iOS 15, but doesn't contain all features.
